## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is a top priority for FitTribe. If you discover a security vulnerability (e.g., related to Supabase RLS policies, Authentication, or data exposure), **please do not report it by creating a public GitHub issue.**

Instead, please privately report the vulnerability to the repository owner. You can do this by:
1. Navigating to the **Security** tab in the GitHub repository.
2. Clicking on **Private vulnerability reporting** (if enabled) and submitting the details there.
3. Alternatively, contact the maintainer directly via their GitHub profile contact info.

Please include:
* A detailed description of the vulnerability.
* Steps to reproduce it.
* Potential impact.

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and work with you to patch the vulnerability and safely disclose it once resolved.
